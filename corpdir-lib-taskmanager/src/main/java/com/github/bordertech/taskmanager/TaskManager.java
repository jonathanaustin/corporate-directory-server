 * <p>
 * As Web applications require a Future implementation that can be serializable, the TaskManager has a custom interface
 * TaskFuture that implements both Future and Serializable. It does not make sense for a Future to be Serializable as it
 * is running on a specific thread on a particular server. To allow a Web Application to keep a reference to the Future,
 * the default implementation of TaskFuture (ie TaskFutureWrapper) wraps the future by putting the Future on a cache and
 * holding onto the cache key that is serializable.
